# code-snippet-rbtree
A sample of Cherrie Wang code, implementation of Red Black tree insert
Taken from Homework Assignment 7, CSCI 104 at USC (Fall 2015)

1) Red Black Tree Insert

rbbst.h contains my solution to this question. test.cpp is my test file, to compile & run, just 'make' and './bin/test'

2) 4 Color Map Theorem (Backtracking and Recursion)

color.cpp, 4color.h and 4color.cpp contains my solution to this question. To compile & run, just 'make' and './bin/color your_input_file_here'

3) Binary Search Tree Iterator

bst.h contains my solution to this question. test.cpp is my test file, to compile & run, just 'make' and './bin/test'
